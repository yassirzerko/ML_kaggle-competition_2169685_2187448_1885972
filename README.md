# Overview 
As part of the INF8245E - MACHINE LEARNING course taught at Polytechnique Montreal, we
must participate in a kaggle competition in teams of 3. The goal is to implement the best machine
learning model that can predict how much a concertgoer will enjoy a concert based on concert and
concertgoer data. 

This github contains the code notebooks of the team **Team Machine**, composed of :
* Noreen Anwar, 2169685, noreen.anwar@polymtl.ca
* Naveed Shahzad, 2187448, naveed.shahzad@polymtl.ca
* Mohamed Yassir El Aoufir, 1885972, mohamed-yassir.el-aoufir@polymtl.ca

# Instructions 
The model responsible for generating the final predictions is in the notebook named ```final.ipynb```, more precisely in section 1.2, more instructions are given in the notebook. 

The notebook named ```initial_exploration.ipynb``` contains some of the explorations and leads we tried during our work, this is the code linked to the section 4.1 *Inital approach* of our report .

**Important** : To run both notebooks, make sure you have files named ```train.csv``` and ```test.csv``` in the runtime environment base folder such that the notebooks can access training and test data with urls: ```train.csv``` and ```test.csv```.

**Important** : Our notebooks are designed to run on google colab, so make sure you are using google colab or replicating the same environment (pre-installed packages...) to run the notebooks.
